README for Thread::Detach

Perl versions before 5.8.4 don't support the "detach" method of the threads
module on Windows!.  This module provides a temporary fix for this problem
if it is running under Windows and with a version of Perl that has the problem.
In any other situation, this module does nothing.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with
any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without threads enabled.
